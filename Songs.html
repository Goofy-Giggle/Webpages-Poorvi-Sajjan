<p><b> My Fav Songs are :</b></p>
<li>Butter - BTS</li>
  <p>Butter by BTS [kpop boy band] is my most favourite song. It's my favourite song since it was the first time a Bts song had been released in a long time, and I was really enchanted by it. All of the armies would understand how important the song BUTTER is to us.
The following are my favourite lyrics from the song:
    <p>Smooth like (butter), cool shade (stunner)</p>
    <p>And you know we don't stop</p>

    <p>Hot like (summer), ain't no (bummer)</p>
    <p>You'll be like, "Oh my God"</p>
    <p>We gon' make you rock, and you say (yeah)</p>
    <p>We gon' make you bounce, and you say (yeah)</p>
    <p>Hotter? Sweeter! Cooler? Butter!</p>

<li>Boy with Luv (feat.halsey) - BTS</li>
<p>BTS's song BOY WITH LUV [feat.hasley] is one of my favourites. Let me tell you why I like this song so much: I really enjoy the music and the words. This song's composition was fantastic. Of course, as a member of the army, I adore this song a lot.
The following are my favourite lines from the song:
  
<p>Listen my my baby 나는</p>
<p>저 하늘을 높이 날고 있어</p>
<p>(그때 니가 내게 줬던 두 날개로)</p>  
<p>이제 여긴 너무 높아</p>
<p>난 내 눈에 널 맞추고 싶어</p>

<li>Permission to Dance - BTS</li>
<p>Now it's time for my second favourite song, PERMISSION TO DANCE by BTS. So I adore this song because it's so meaningful that just looking at the title makes you happy...of course, like the title says, we don't need permission to dance...
This song's lyrics that I like the most are:
  
<p>I wanna dance, the music's got me going</p>
<p>Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah</p>
<p>Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden</p>
<p>And roll in like we're dancing fools</p>
<p>We don't need to worry</p>
<p>'Cause when we fall, we know how to land<p>
<p>Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight</p>
<p>'Cause we don't need permission to dance</p>

<li>BIRTHDAY - Somi</li>
<p>SOMI's Birthday is also a fantastic song. It's the first Korean song I've ever liked sung by a woman. I also enjoy her song DUMB DUMB, which was recommended to me by one of my best friend.
This song's lyrics that I like the most are:
  
<p>나의 365 and 24/7</p>
<p>일 월 화 수 목 금 토</p>
<p>It's my birthday, yeah</p>

<li>Million to one - Camila Cabello</li>
<p>MILLION TO ONE by Camila Cabello is now my most favourite songs. This song is one of my favourites since it has always encouraged me in some manner. Anyone who listens to and knows the words of this song will realise how motivating it is... It's from the Amazon Prime Video film CINDRELLA [not a sponsor].
These are my favourite phrases from the song:
  
<p>When I feel my fear staring at me</p>
<p>I tell it just wait and see</p>
<p>I know who I'm gonna be</p>
<p>I know who I'm gonna be</p>
<p>The world's half-asleep</p>
<p>It's gonna wake up and see</p>

<li>Boombayah - BlackPink</li>
<p>BOOMAYAH by BLACKPINK [kpop girl band] is my all-time favourite song. It's a song that makes me happy all of the time. And the song's music is so loud and rapid that it makes me even happier and more interested in it.
This song's best lines are:
  
<p>붐바야</p>
<p>Yah yah yah 붐바야</p>
<p>Yah yah yah 붐바야 yah yah yah yah</p>
<p>붐붐바 붐붐바 (오빠!)</p>

<p>(Hot) BLACKPINK in your area</p>
